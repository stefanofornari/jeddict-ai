- create the following versions of the commit message:
  - Very short
  - Short
  - Medium length
  - Long
  - Descriptive
- review the changes and provide feedback following the bewlow instructions:
  - base your review strictly on the provided Git diff
  - focus areas:
    - bugs, unsafe behavior, or runtime risks
    - readability, naming, and clarity
    - best practices or conventions
    - opportunities for simplification or performance improvement
  - anchor each suggestion to a specific hunk header from the diff
